# SYNOPSIS
A LevelDB GUI. Includes simple data visualization tools.

# USAGE

## Installation
Levelweb can be run as a process or used as a module on top of your own 
LevelDB-based database.

```bash
npm install levelweb -g
```

## Create an initial user account
Levelweb supports encrypted login over https

```bash
levelweb -u admin -p password
```

## Connect to a local database 
Levelweb can be a server and accept input from simple tcp, tls or [rpc][0].

```bash
levelweb ./test/data
```

## Connect to a remote database
Levelweb can be a client and connect to a network enabled [Levelup][1] instance.

```bash
levelweb --client 9099 --host 192.168.0.1
```

## Log into the user interface

## Communicate with the database

```js
var client = require('multilevel').client();
var net = require('net');

var myPort = 9099;

client.pipe(net.connect(myPort)).pipe(client)

// asynchronous methods
client.put('foo', 'bar', function (err) { 
  if (!err) { /* the value is now in the database */ }
});

// streams
client.createReadStream().on('data', function () { /* */ });
```

# CLI PARAMETERS

## User Management
```
-u <username>   specify a username to create or check for
-p <password>   specify a password for the given username
```

## User Interface
```
--https <n>     a port for the user-interface to run on
--host <h>      ip or hostname for the web server if not localhost
```

## Data
```
--protocol <p>  specify the protocol where `p` is `tls` or `tcp`
--client <n>    the port to connect to as a client, `n` is a port
--server <n>    the port to make available as a server, `n` is a port
```

Level web also accepts new-line-delimited data. Each line should be an object 
that contains a key and value, like `{ key: 'foo', value: 'bar' }`.

```
--newline       alternatively receive newline delimited streams.
```

If you use `tls` as your protocol, you'll need to supply the server's 
certificate (you can copy this from the UI's settings tab) and generate a 
private key with a self signed certificate.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out client-key.pem 1024
openssl req -new -key client-key.pem -out client-csr.pem
openssl x509 -req -in client-csr.pem -signkey client-key.pem -out client-cert.pem
```

# VISUALIZATIONS

## Treemap
Provides a zoomable tree-map of the currently tagged keys. Treemaps display 
hierarchical (tree-structured) data as a set of nested rectangles. Each branch
of the tree is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles 
representing sub-branches. A leaf node's rectangle has an area proportional to 
a specified dimension on the data. Often the leaf nodes are colored to show a 
separate dimension of the data.

When the color and size dimensions are correlated in some way with the tree 
structure, one can often easily see patterns that would be difficult to spot in 
other ways, such as if a certain color is particularly relevant. A second 
advantage of treemaps is that, by construction, they make efficient use of 
space. As a result, they can legibly display thousands of items on the screen 
simultaneously.

## Stacked Bar Chart

### Stacked Area Chart
Area charts are used to represent cumulated totals using numbers or percentages 
(stacked area charts in this case) over time. Use the area chart for showing 
trends over time among related attributes. The area chart is like the plot chart
except that the area below the plotted line is filled in with color to indicate 
volume.

When multiple attributes are included, the first attribute is plotted as a line 
with color fill followed by the second attribute, and so on.

# DEVELOPER NOTES

## Making changes
```
-b              compile all of the addon css and html
```

### How the code is organized

### `bin`
Contains an executable file responsible for starting the app and passing 
parameters to the levelweb module. Yes, you can add levelweb on top of your 
database project.

### `lib`
Contains all of the server code. The index file is the point of entry and 
handles static file serving as well as communication to and from the server.
